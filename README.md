honolulu_answers_cookbooks
==========================

This repo contains cookbooks for deploying the Honolulu Answers application. It's intended to be used as part of an OpsWorks stack spun up using the templates and scripts in the [Honolulu Answers](https://github.com/stelligent/honolulu_answers) demo application. It should work in any Chef environment, but it's never been tested so try at your own risk.
